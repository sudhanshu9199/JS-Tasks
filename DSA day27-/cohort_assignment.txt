 value of F2 + F4 + F6 +â€¦â€¦â€¦+ F2n till N number.
 Where Fi indicates the iâ€™th Fibonacci number.
   Input: n = 4
Output: 33
N = 4, So here the fibonacci series will be produced from 0th term till 8th term:

0 + 1 + 3 + 8 + 21 + 55 + 144 + 377 = 609.



// array
18. Given a sorted array of distinct elements, the task is to 
find the summation of absolute differences of all pairs in the given array.

Examples: 

Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: 10
Sum of |2-1| + |3-1| + |4-1| +
       |3-2| + |4-2| + |4-3| = 10

19. You are given two arrays of **equal length**:

* An **integer array** `A[]`
* A **character array** `B[]`, where each character is one of `'a'`, `'b'`, or `'c'`

Each element in array `B` is associated with the corresponding element in array `A`, i.e., `B[i]` is linked to `A[i]` for all valid indices `i`.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ **Task:**

Find the **minimum** value of the expression:

```
min(sum of values linked with 'a' + sum of values linked with 'b', 
    sum of values linked with 'c')
```

That is:

```
min(a_sum + b_sum, c_sum)
```

Where:

* `a_sum` = sum of all A[i] where B[i] == 'a'
* `b_sum` = sum of all A[i] where B[i] == 'b'
* `c_sum` = sum of all A[i] where B[i] == 'c'

---

### ðŸ§¾ Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
A[] = {3, 6, 4, 5, 6}
B[] = {'a', 'c', 'b', 'b', 'a'}

Output:
6

Explanation:
'a' â†’ 3 + 6 = 9  
'b' â†’ 4 + 5 = 9  
'c' â†’ 6  
â†’ min(9 + 9, 6) = min(18, 6) = 6
```

---

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
A[] = {4, 2, 6, 2, 3}
B[] = {'b', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'b'}

Output:
5

Explanation:
'a' â†’ 2 + 2 = 4  
'b' â†’ 4 + 3 = 7  
'c' â†’ 6  
â†’ min(4 + 7, 6) = min(11, 6) = 6
Oops! Looks wrong. Let's double check.

Actually:
â†’ a_sum = 2 + 2 = 4  
â†’ b_sum = 4 + 3 = 7  
â†’ c_sum = 6  
â†’ a + b = 4 + 4 = **8** (mistake before)

Still:
â†’ min(4 + 7 = 11, 6) = **6**

```

Input:
A\[] = {4, 2, 6, 1, 3}
B\[] = {'b', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'b'}

'a' â†’ 2 + 1 = 3
'b' â†’ 4 + 3 = 7
'c' â†’ 6
â†’ min(3 + 7, 6) = min(10, 6) = 6

```
```


20. Given an array of integers, update every element with the multiplication of previous and next elements with the following exceptions.

a) The First element is replaced by the multiplication of the first and second. 
b) The last element is replaced by multiplication of the last and second last.

Example:  

Input  : arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Output : arr[] = {6, 8, 15, 24, 30}

21. We are given an array of Integers. We have to perform the following operation on the array until it is fully exhausted. 

Select the max number in the array and delete that number including all the numbers to its right side in the array.
Repeat the step 1 for the left elements of the array i.e select the maximum element in the left elements  and delete it including all numbers to its right.
Our task is to simulate the above procedure and return the number of steps that will be taken until the first element(index 0) of the array is also deleted and array is said to be exhausted.

Input : Array = [2, 3, 5, 4, 1]
Output : Steps Taken: 3
Explanation: Step 1: Remove 5 and elements to its right
             so, Array becomes [2, 3]
             Step 2: Remove 3 as it is the maximum and 
             right most already so, Array becomes [2]
             Step 3: Remove 2 and the array becomes EMPTY
             Hence, at the end of step 3 the array stands 
             exhausted.


22.Given an array of even size, task is to find minimum value that can be added to an element so that array become balanced.
An array is balanced if the sum of the left half of the array elements is equal to the sum of right half. Suppose, we have an array 1 3 1 2 4 3.
The Sum of first three elements is 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 and sum of last three elements is 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 
So this is unbalanced, to make it balanced the minimum number we can add is 4 to any element in first half.

Examples : 

Input : 1 2 1 2 1 3
Output : 2
Sum of first 3 elements is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, 
sum of last three elements is 2 + 1 + 3 = 6
To make the array balanced you can add 2.

Input : 20 10
Output : 10
