# Marvel Freelancers Hiring â€” Dynamic Card Display

## About This Project

This project is a fun, interactive web app that displays a list of Marvel superheroes as "freelancers" available for hire. Each hero is presented as a card showing their name, role, team, status, hourly rate, skills, and a quirky bio. Users can click the "Hire" button on each card to toggle its state, simulating the hiring process.

## How It Works

- **Data Structure:** All freelancer details are stored in a JavaScript array of objects.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** The cards are generated dynamically using JavaScript, looping through the array and injecting HTML into the page.
- **Interactivity:** Clicking the "Hire" button changes its label to "For your work" (or toggles back), updating the card instantly.
- **Styling:** The project uses custom CSS and Google Fonts for a modern, playful look.

## Why Was This Created?

This project was built as a homework task for a Live COHORT class. The goal was to practice DOM manipulation, dynamic rendering, and event handling in JavaScript, while also having fun with creative data.
